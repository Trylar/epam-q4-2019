# Define a function generate_numbers(number) which returns a dictionary where
# the keys are numbers between 1 and n (both included) and
# the values are square of keys. n â€“ function argument. Default is 20.
def generate_numbers(n=20):
    return dict([(i, i * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)])


# Define a function count_characters(count_me_string) which count and return
# the numbers of each character in a count_me_string argument.
# Example:
# If the following string is given as argument to the function:
# abcdefgabc
# Then, the return result of the function should be:
# {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2, 'd': 1, 'e': 1, 'f': 1, 'g': 1}
def count_characters(count_me_string):
    dct = {}
    for ltr in count_me_string:
        dct[ltr] = dct.get(ltr, 0) + 1
    return dct


# second version
